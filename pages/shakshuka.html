    <h1>Shakshuka</h1>
    <img src="../images/shakshuka.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Though it's North African in origin, these days shakshuka is popular throughout the Middle East and in hip neighborhood diners all over the coastal US. Given its versatility, it's easy to see why. It's quick; it's simple; it's easy to scale up or down; and it works for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>
    <h2>Why It Works</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Charring the peppers and onions gives them another dimension of flavor.</li>
        <li>Whole canned tomatoes have better flavor than diced, and are more consistent year-round than fresh ones.</li>
        <li>Spooing the tomato mixture over the egg whites helps them set faster, allowing you to leave the yolks runnier.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large red pepper with stems, seeds, and ribs removed. Thinly sliced.</li>
        <li>1 fresh small hot chili (such as fresno, jalapeno, or serrano) with stems, seeds, and ribs removed. Thinly sliced.</li>
        <li>2 to 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tbsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 tsp whole or ground cumin seed</li>
        <li>1 (28oz) can whole peeled tomatoes, crushed by squeezing between fingers.</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Large handful minced cilantro, parsley, or a mix</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>Sliced oil-cured black olives, feta cheese, or artichoke hearts, for serving (all optional)</li>
        <li>Crusty bread, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large, deep skillet or straight-sided saut√© pan over high heat until shimmering. Add onion, red pepper, and chile and spread into an even layer. Cook, without moving, until vegetables on the bottom are deeply browned and beginning to char in spots, about 6 minutes. Stir and repeat. Continue to cook until vegetables are fully softened and spottily charred, about another 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add paprika and cumin and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Immediately add tomatoes and stir to combine (see notes). Reduce heat to a bare simmer and simmer for 10 minutes, then season to taste with salt and pepper and stir in half of cilantro or parsley. </li>
        <li>Using a large spoon, make a well near the perimeter of the pan and break an egg directly into it. Spoon a little sauce over edges of egg white to partially submerge and contain it, leaving yolk exposed. Repeat with remaining 5 eggs, working around pan as you go. Season eggs with a little salt, cover, reduce heat to lowest setting, and cook until egg whites are barely set and yolks are still runny, 5 to 8 minutes. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle with remaining cilantro or parsley, along with any of the optional toppings. Serve immediately with crusty bread. </li>
    </ol>
